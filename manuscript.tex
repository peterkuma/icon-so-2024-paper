\section*{Abstract}

Currently, a new generation of km-scale resolution global climate models are in development as the forthcoming phase of climate modelling. One such model is a 5-km version of the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic Weather and Climate Model (ICON) developed jointly by Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) and the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M). Because of the high resolution, most parametrisations, such as that of convection and clouds, can be avoided.

Previous studies have identified substantial large-scale biases in model clouds over the Southern Ocean (SO), affecting sea surface temperature and the Earth's albedo overall. Our aim is to quantify how well the high-resolution ICON model is simulating clouds in this region, particularly in light of the fact that subgrid-scale clouds are not parametrised in this model. This region is mostly dominated by boundary layer clouds generated by shallow convection, and these are problematic to observe by spaceborne lidar and radars, which are affected by attenuation by overlapping and thick clouds and ground clutter, respectively. Therefore, we choose to use a large set of ship-based observations conducted with ceilometers and lidars on board of RV \textit{Polarstern} and other voyages. Altogether, we analyse over 2000 days (about 6 years) of data from 31 voyages and 1 sub-antarctic station covering diverse longitudes of the SO. To achieve a like-for-like comparison with the model, we use a ground-based lidar simulator called the Automatic Lidar and Ceilometer Framework (ALCF). We contrast the results with the ECMWF Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2).

We show that the model underestimates the total cloud fraction by about 10\%, with overestimation of cloud below 2 km, and underestimation of cloud above 2 km. The reanalyses also underestimate the total cloud fraction by about 20\%. ERA5 overestimates cloud below 1 km but underestimates near-surface cloud or fog. In addition to lidar data, we compare radiosonde profiles acquired on the RV \textit{Polarstern} voyages with ICON. Notably, the model exhibits smaller natural variability than observations, and its lifting condensation level tends to be higher. This might explain why cloud occurrence is peaking higher in the model (at 500 m) than in observations (at the surface).

The results imply that the SO cloud biases are still a significant issue in a km-scale resolution model, even though an improvement over the lower-resolution reanalyses is notable. More effort is needed to improve model cloud simulations in this fast-changing and understudied region. The advancement from convection and cloud parametrisation to cloud-resolving models might not solve this bias without an additional effort.

\section{Introduction}

Increasing climate model resolution is a common way of improving model
accuracy \citep{mauritsen2022}. This is of course limited by the available
computational power and a trade-off with increasing parametrisation complexity.
Current computational availability is progressing to enable km-scale Earth
system models (ESMs) and coupled atmophsere--ocean general circulation models
(AOGCMs) in research conditions today and operationally in the forthcoming
years. Therefore, it represents a natural advacement in climate modeling.
Representative of this efforts is the DYnamics of the Atmospheric general
circulation Modeled On Non-hydrostatic Domains (DYAMOND) project
\citep{stevens2019}, which is an intercomparison of global storm-resolving
models.

The NextGEMS project is focused on the research and
development of high resolution (km-scale) global storm-resolving climate models
(GSRMs), which are planned to be the next generation of operational climate
models. Because of the high resolution, some previously parameterised physical
processes can be resolved on the model grid. Thus, such parameterisations and
related uncertainties can be eliminated.

The main aim of our research is to evaluate a high-resolution version of the
Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic Weather and Climate Model (ICON), developed by
NextGEMS jointly with Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) and the Max-Planck-Institute
for Meteorology (MPI-M). Previous studies have identified substantial
large-scale biases in climate model clouds over the Southern Ocean (SO), affecting
sea surface temperature and the Earth’s albedo overall. Our aim is to quantify
how well the high-resolution ICON model is simulating clouds in this region,
particularly in light of the fact that subgrid-scale clouds are not
parameterised in this model. This region is mostly dominated by boundary layer
clouds generated by shallow convection, and these are problematic to observe by
spaceborne lidar and radars, which are affected by attenuation by overlapping
and thick clouds and ground clutter, respectively. Therefore, we chose to use
a large set of ship-based observations conducted with ceilometers and lidars on
board of the RV \emph{Polarstern} and other voyages and stations.

Marine clouds have disproportionate effect on TOA shortwave radiation due to
the relatively low albedo of the sea surface. The longitudinal symmetry of the
SO means that model cloud biases tend to be similar across
longitudes.

Altogether, we analysed over 1500 days of data from 31 voyages and one
sub-Antarctic station covering diverse longitudes of the SO. To
achieve a like-for-like comparison with the model, we used a ground-based lidar
simulator called the Automatic Lidar and Ceilometer Framework (ALCF)
\citep{kuma2021}. We contrasted the results with the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) \citep{era5} and the
Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2
(MERRA-2) \citep{gelaro2017}.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Voyage and station data}

Together, we analysed data from 31 voyages of RV \emph{Polarstern}, RSV
\emph{Aurora Australis}, RV \emph{Tangaroa}, RV \emph{Nathaniel B. Palmer},
HMNZS \emph{Wellington} and one sub-Antarctic station (Macquarie Island) in the
SO south of 40°S between year 2010 and 2021 (Fig. \ref{fig:map} and
Table \ref{tab:voyages}). Altogether, the voyages and the station comprised
2421 days of data south of 40$^\circ$S, but the availability of ceilometer data
was smaller.

These data sources contained ceilometer (lidar) observations with the Vaisala
CL51 operating at 910 nm and the Lufft CHM-15k operating at 1064 nm. A
ceilometer is a low-power vertically pointing lidar with the purpose of
measuring the cloud base, but it also measures the full vertical structure of
clouds as long as the laser signal is not attenuated by thick clouds. A total
of about 1500 days of lidar observations were included in our analysis.

Apart from lidar observations, radiosondes were launched on weather balloons
at regular synoptic times on the RV \emph{Polarstern} voyages, and surface
meteorological quantities were measured continuously.

\subsection{ICON}

A coupled storm-resolving version of the ICON model is in development by the
NextGEMS project \citep{hohenegger2023}. NextGEMS has so far produced four
cycles of model runs. In our research, we used a Cycle 3 run ngc3028 produced
in 2023 \citep{nextgems2023a,nextgems2023b}. We could not use Cycle 4 due to unavailability of
the necessary variables. The horizontal resolution of ngc3028 is about 5 km.
Unlike current general circulation models (GCMs), the strom-resolving version
of ICON does not use convective and cloud parameterisation but relies on
explicit simulation of convection and clouds on the model grid. While this
makes the code development simpler without having to rely on uncertain
parameterisations, it can miss smaller-scale clouds below the grid resolution.
Turbulence and cloud microphysics are still parameterised in this model. In our
analysis, we used four years of coupled simulation output between years 2021
and 2024 (inclusive). Because the model is free-running, weather and climate
oscillations (such as the El Niño--Southern Oscillation) are not expected to be
equivalent to reality at the same time and place. To compare with observations
taken during different years (2010--2021), we compared the model output with
observations at the same time of year and geographical location.

\subsection{ALCF}

The Automatic Lidar and Ceilometer Framework (ALCF) is a ground-based lidar
simulator. It performs radiative transfer calculations to derive equivalent
lidar backscattered radiation in an atmospheric model, which can then
be compared with observed lidar backscatter \citep{kuma2021}. For this purpose,
it takes atmospheric fields of cloud fraction, liquid and ice mass mixing ratio,
temperature and pressure fields as an input and can be run offline (on the
model output rather than inside the model code). The lidar simulator in the
ALCF is based on the instrument simulator Cloud Feedback Model
Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulator Package (COSP)
\citep{bodas-salcedo2011}. After the backscattered radiation is calculated, a
cloud mask, cloud occurrence by height and the total cloud fraction are
determined.

ALCF has already been used by several research teams for model and reanalysis
evaluation
\citep{kuma2020,kremser2021,guyot2022,pei2023,whitehead2023,mcdonald2024}.

\subsection{Vaisala CL51}

The Vaisala CL51 is a ceilometer operating at a near-infrared wavelength of 910
nm. The maximum range 15.4 km, vertical resolution 10 m, and the number of
vertical levels is 1540. The wavelength is affected by water vapour absorption
of about 20\% in the mid-latitudes \citep{wiegner2015,wiegner2019}.  The
instrument data files containing uncalibrated backscatter were first converted
to NetCDF with cl2nc (\url{https://github.com/peterkuma/cl2nc}) and then
processed with the ALCF to produce a cloud mask and cloud occurrence by height
and the total cloud fraction.

% TODO: Describe absolute calibration.

\subsection{Lufft CHM 15k}

The Lufft CHM 15k is a ceilometer operating at a near-infrared wavelength of
1064 nm. The maximum range is 15.4 km, vertical resolution is 5 m in the near
range (up to 150 m) and 15 m above, the sampling rate is 2 s, and the number of
vertical levels is 1024.  NetCDF files containing uncalibrated backscatter
produced by the instrument were processed with the ALCF to produce a cloud mask
and cloud occurrence by height and the total cloud fraction.

% TODO: Describe absolute calibration.
% TODO: Check sampling rate.

\subsection{MERRA-2}

\subsection{ERA5}

ERA5 \citep{era5} is a reanalysis produced by the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). It is based on a numerical weather
prediction (NWP) model Integrated Forecast System (IFS) version CY41R2.  The
horizontal resolution is 0.25$^\circ$ in latitude and longitude (about 28 km in
the North--South direction and 14 km in the East--West direction at
60$^\circ$S). The model uses 137 vertical levels.

\subsection{Cyclone tracking}

We used a cyclone tracking algorithm to identify extratropical and polar
cyclones (ECs and PCs) over the SO in the reanalysis and ICON data,
for the purpose of partitioning the cloud occurrence data into cyclonic and
non-cyclonic conditions. We used the open source package CyTRACK
\citep{perez-alarcon2024}. Generally, what constitutes an EC is considered
relatively arbitrary due to a very large variability of ECs \citep{neu2013}.
We used the mean sea level pressure field and horizontal wind speed fields
as input to the CyTRACK algorithm. The algorithm uses pressure and wind
speed thresholds as well as tracking across time steps to identify cyclone
centres and radii.

\subsection{Precipitation identification using machine learning}
\label{sec:ann}

It was not possible to include precipitation simulation in the ALCF due to the
absence of required fields in our model output and reanalysis data (liquid and
ice precipitation mass mixing ratios) because the required radiation
calculations are not implemented in the ALCF. At the same time, it is relatively
difficult to distinguish precipitation backscatter from cloud backscatter
in lidar observations, especially when only one wavelength channel and no
polarisation channel are available.

In order to get a fair comparison of observations and models, one needs to
exclude profiles with precipitation either manually or using an automated
method. In models, this can be accomplished relatively easily by excluding
profiles with an amount of surface precipitation flux exceeding a threshold.
In observations, this can be more complicated, especially on voyages, because
rain gauges are known to be unreliable on ships.

On the RV \emph{Polarstern} voyages, regular synoptic observations were
available.  These included precipitation observations by an observer. We
used this dataset to train a convolutional artiﬁcial neural network (ANN)
of the U-Net type \citep{ronneberger2015} to recognise precipitation in the
lidar data. Samples of short time intervals (10 min) of near-surface
backscatter (0–250 m) were classified as clear, rain, snow and fog, using the
synoptic observations as a training set. From these, a binary classification of
profiles as wet or dry was derived.

The ANN achieved 65\% sensitivity and 87\% speciﬁcity when the true positive
rate (26\%) was made to match observations. We considered these success rates
satisfactory for the purpose of filtering precipitation profiles.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Cloud occurrence}

We used the ALCF to derive cloud occurrence by height and the total cloud
fraction from observations, ICON and two reanalyses MERRA-2 and ERA5 (Fig.
\ref{fig:cloud-occurrence-panel}). We aggregated the sources by calculating
the averages and percentiles of all individual profiles (Fig.
\ref{fig:cloud-occurrence}). The analysis shows that the total cloud fraction
(determined as the fraction of proﬁles with clouds at any height in the lidar
cloud mask) is underestimated in ICON and reanalyses by about 10\% and 20\%,
respectively.

In particular, ICON overestimates cloud occurrence below 1 km and
underestimates it above, MERRA-2 underestimates cloud occurrence at all heights,
especially near the surface, and ERA5 simulates cloud occurrence relatively well
above 1 km, but strongly underestimates it near the surface.
We note that fog or near-surface clouds are strongly lacking in the reanalyses.
As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:cloud-occurrence-panel}, the biases are relatively
consistent across voyages and longitudes. The ICON results are overall better
matching the observations than the reanalyses.

The ICON comparison is limited by the fact that the model is free-running.
Thus, the vertical proﬁles are not expected to represent the same weather
conditions as in observations, but long-term statistical comparison is still
possible. Only proﬁles with the same sea ice conditions (present or not) were
included to avoid comparing sea ice with open sea conditions.

\subsection{Thermodynamic proﬁles}

We compared about 2000 radiosonde proﬁles from 24 RV \emph{Polarstern}
voyages between the observations and the model. Proﬁles in the model were taken
at the same geographical location and time relative to the start of the year.
Only proﬁles for which the sea ice conditions (sea ice present or absent) are
the same in the observations and the model were included. We derived potential
temperature profiles, lifting condensation level (LCL), and aggregated the
profiles by sea ice conditions (Fig. \ref{fig:radiosonde}).

We found that the variability of potential temperature in the model to be
smaller than in the observations. This indicates that the model does not
represent the entire natural variability. The LCL peaks at the surface in the
observations, but the peak in the model is higher (about 200 m). This probably
relates to the greater occurrence of fog and the peak of cloud occurrence at
the surface in observations, whereas in the model the peak is higher.

\subsection{Cloud occurrence by cyclonic conditions}

\subsection{Cloud occurrence by stability}

We determine stability by calculating lower tropospheric stability (LTS)
as the difference between potential temperature at 700 hPa and the surface.
From a histogram of LTS in ERA5 and MERRA-2 calculated at all voyage tracks
and the station (Fig. S1), we determined a dividing threshold of 12 K for
relatively unstable (< 12 K) and relatively stable (>= 12 K) conditions.

\section{Discussion}

\section{Conclusions}

We show that the model underestimates the total cloud fraction by about 10\%,
with an overestimation of clouds below 2 km, and an underestimation of clouds
above 2 km. The reanalyses also underestimate the total cloud fraction by about
20\%.  ERA5 overestimates cloud below 1 km but underestimates near-surface
cloud or fog. In addition to lidar data, we compare radiosonde profiles
acquired on the RV \textit{Polarstern} voyages with ICON. Notably, the model
exhibits smaller natural variability than observations, and its lifting
condensation level tends to be higher. This might explain why cloud occurrence
is peaking higher in the model (at 500 m) than in observations (at the
surface).

We compared radiosonde proﬁles acquired on the RV \emph{Polarstern} voyages
with ICON.  The ICON model exhibits smaller internal variability than
observations, and its LCL level tends to be higher, which might explain why a
peak of cloud occurrence in observations is located at the surface, while in
ICON it is located higher, corresponding to the LCL.

The results imply that SO cloud biases are still a significant
issue in a km-scale resolution model, even though an improvement over the
lower-resolution reanalyses is notable. More effort is needed to improve model
cloud simulations in this fast-changing and understudied region. The
advancement from convection and cloud parameterisation to cloud-resolving models
might not solve this bias without additional effort.

Further analysis will focus on investigating the role of cyclones in the
identified biases by using cyclone tracking and the role of local thermodynamic
stability using lower tropospheric stability and estimated inversion strength.
