\section*{Abstract}

Currently, a new generation of km-scale (also called `k-scale') resolution
global climate models is in development as the forthcoming phase of climate
modelling. One such model is a 5-km version of the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic
Weather and Climate Model (ICON), developed jointly by the Deutscher
Wetterdienst (DWD) and Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M). Because of
the high resolution, most parametrisations, such as those of convection and
clouds, can be avoided.

Previous studies have identified substantial large-scale biases in model clouds
over the Southern Ocean (SO), affecting sea surface temperature and the Earth's
albedo overall. Our aim is to quantify how well the high-resolution ICON model
is simulating clouds in this region, particularly in light of the fact that
subgrid-scale clouds are not parametrised in this model. This region is mostly
dominated by boundary layer clouds generated by shallow convection, and these
are problematic to observe by spaceborne lidar and radars, which are affected
by attenuation by overlapping and thick clouds and ground clutter,
respectively. Therefore, we choose to use a large set of ship-based
observations conducted with ceilometers and lidars on board of the Research
Vessel (RV) \textit{Polarstern} and other voyages. Altogether, we analyse over
2000 days (about 6 years) of data from 31 voyages and 1 sub-antarctic station
covering diverse longitudes of the SO. To achieve a like-for-like comparison
with the model, we use a ground-based lidar simulator called the Automatic
Lidar and Ceilometer Framework (ALCF). We contrast the results with the ECMWF
Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and
Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2).

We show that the model underestimates the total cloud fraction by about 10\%,
with overestimation of cloud below 2 km and underestimation of cloud above 2
km. The reanalyses also underestimate the total cloud fraction by about 20\%.
ERA5 overestimates cloud below 1 km but underestimates near-surface cloud or
fog. In addition to lidar data, we compare radiosonde profiles acquired on the
RV \textit{Polarstern} voyages with ICON. Notably, the model exhibits smaller
natural variability than observations, and its lifting condensation level tends
to be higher. This might explain why cloud occurrence is peaking higher in the
model (at 500 m) than in observations (at the surface).

The results imply that the SO cloud biases are still a significant issue in a
km-scale resolution model, even though an improvement over the lower-resolution
reanalyses is notable. More effort is needed to improve model cloud simulations
in this fast-changing and understudied region. The advancement from convection
and cloud parametrisation to cloud-resolving models might not solve this bias
without an additional effort.

\section{Introduction}

Increasing climate model resolution is a common way of improving model accuracy
\citep{mauritsen2022}. This is of course limited by the available computational
power and a tradeoff with increasing parametrisation complexity.  Current
computational availability and acceleration from general-purpose computing on
graphics processing units (GPGPUs) is progressing to enable km-scale Earth
system models (ESMs) and coupled atmosphsere--ocean general circulation models
(AOGCMs) in research conditions today and operationally in the forthcoming
years. Therefore, it represents a natural advancement in climate modeling.
Global strom-resolving models (GSRMs) are emerging as a new front in the
development of high-resolution global climate models, with horizontal grid
resolutions of about 2--8 km \citep{satoh2019,stevens2019}. This is enough to
resolve mesoscale convective storms, but smaller-scale convective plumes and
smaller-scale cloud structure remain unresolved. At a 5-km scale,
non-hydrostatic processes also become important, and for this reason such
models are generally non-hydrostatic. The terms global cloud-resolving models
(GCRMs), or global convection-permitting/-resolving models (GCPMs) are also
sometimes used interchangeably with GSRMs but imply that clouds or convection
are resolved explicitly, which is not entirely true for GSRMs, as this would
require an even higher horizontal resolution \citep{satoh2019}.  Representative
of these efforts is the DYnamics of the Atmospheric general circulation Modeled
On Non-hydrostatic Domains (DYAMOND) project \citep{stevens2019,dyamond}, which
is an intercomparison of nine global storm-resolving models (GSRMs) on two
40-day time periods in summer (1 August -- 10 September 2016) and winter (20
January - 1 March 2020). A new one-year GSRM intercomparison is currently
proposed by \cite{takasuka2024}, with the hope of also evaluating the seasonal
cycle and large-scale circulation.  An alternative to using a
computantionally costly GSRM is to train an artificial neural network on GSRM
output and use it for subgrid-scale clouds, as done with the GSRM ICON by
\cite{grundner2022}; \cite{grundner2023}.

nextGEMS is an EU-funded project \citep{nextgems} focused on the research and
development of GSRMs at multiple modelling centres and universities in Europe.
The project also develops GSRM versions of the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic
Weather and Climate Model (ICON), the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), and
their ocean components at eddy-resolving resolutions: ICON-O coupled with ICON
and Finite-Element/volumE Sea ice-Ocean Model (FESOM) and Nucleus for European
Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) coupled with IFS.  The project has so far
produced ICON and IFS simulations in three cycles (Cycle 1--3) and pre-final
simulation, with a final production simulation planned by the end of the
project. nextGEMS is not the only project developing GSRMs. Other GSRMs (or
GSRM versions of climate models) currently in development include:
Convection-Permitting Simulations With the E3SM Global Atmosphere Model
[SCREAM; \cite{caldwell2021}], Atmospheric Model [NICAM; \cite{satoh2008}],
Unified Model (UM), eXperimental System for High-resolution modeling for
Earth-to-Local Domain [X-SHiELD; \cite{shield}], Action de Recherche Petite
Echelle Grande Echelle-NonHydrostatic version [ARPEGE-NH;
\cite{bubnova1995,voldoire2017}], Finite-Volume Dynamical Core on the Cubed
Sphere [FV3, \cite{lin2004}], NASA Goddard Earth Observing System global
atmospheric model version 5 [GEOS5; \cite{putman2011}], Model for Prediction
Across Scales [MPAS; \cite{skamarock2012}], and System for Atmospheric Modeling
[SAM; \cite{khairoutdinov2003}].

Multiple cloud properties have an effect on the shortwave (SW) and longwave
(LW) radiation. On the first order, it is the total cloud fraction, cloud phase,
and the liquid and ice water path. These are influenced by the atmopheric
thermodynamics, convection and circulation, and indirect and direct effects
of aerosols. On smaller orders, it is the cloud droplet size distribution, ice
crystal habit, cloud lifetime, and direct radiative interaction with aerosols.
In the 6th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project [CMIP6;
\citep{eyring2016}], the cloud feedback has increased relative to CMIP5
\citep{zelinka2020}, also being one of the main reasons for the higher climate
sensitivity of CMIP6 models.

The Southern Ocean (SO) is known to be a problematic region for climate model
biases due to reasons such as a lack of surface and in situ observations and
being a lower priority region for numerical weather prediction (NWP) and
climate model development because it is far away from populated areas of
interest.  Nevertheless, radiation biases and changes over an area of its size
have a very significant influence on the global climate, and the SO is an
important part of the global ocean conveyor belt.  Marine clouds have
disproportionate effect on top of atmosphere (TOA) SW radiation due to the
relatively low albedo of the sea surface.  The longitudinal symmetry of the SO
means that model cloud biases tend to be similar across longitudes.  Here, we
will conventionally refer to the SO as ocean regions south of 40°S,
low-latitude SO as 40--55°S and high-latitude SO as south of
55°S.

SO radiation biases have been relatively large and systematic compared to the
rest of the globe since at least CMIP3 \citep{trenberth2010}, and the SO SW CRE
bias is still positive in eight analysed CMIP6 models analysed by
\cite{schuddeboom2021} over high-latitude SO, whereas over low-latitude SO it
tends to be more neutral or negative in some models. Too much absorbed SW
radiation over the SO was also identified in the GSRM SCREAM
\cite{caldwell2021}. Compensating biases are possible, such as the `too few too
bright' cloud bias, characterised by too small cloud fraction and too large
cloud albedo \citep{wall2017,kuma2020}, previously described by
\cite{webb2001}, \cite{weare2004}, \cite{zhang2005}, \cite{karlsson2008},
\cite{nam2012}, \cite{klein2013}, and \cite{bender2017} in other regions and
models. That is, a model maintains a resonable SW radiation balance by
reflecting too much SW radiation by cloudy sky but has too little cloudy sky
area overall. A study by \cite{konsta2022} showed that this type bias is still
present in six analysed CMIP6 models in tropical marine clouds, using the
GCM-Oriented Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation
(CALIPSO) Cloud Product [CALIPSO--GOCCP; \cite{chepfer2010}] and Polarization
\& Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Sciences coupled with
Observations from a Lidar [PARASOL; \citep{lier2008}] as a reference. They
suggest improper simulation of subgrid-scale cloud heterogeneity as a cause.
Compensating cloud biases in the Australian Community Climate and Earth System
Simulator (ACCESS) – Atmosphere-only model version 2 (AM2) over the SO were
analysed by \cite{fiddes2022} and \cite{fiddes2024}.  \cite{possner2022} showed
that over the SO, the DYAMOND GSRM ICON underestimates low-level cloud fraction
on the order of 30\% [relative to the Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS)] and overestimates downwelling TOA SW radiation on
the order of 10 Wm$^\mathrm{-2}$ in  [relative to the Clouds and the Earth’s
Radiant Energy System (CERES)] in the highest model resolution run (2.5 km).
\cite{zhao2022} reported a similar SW radiation bias in five analysed CMIP6
models over high-latitude SO and total CF underestimation on the order of 10\%
over the entire 40--60°S SO.

In general, SST biases in the SO can originate either in the atmosphere, caused
by too much shortwave heating of the surface, too little longwave cooling of
the surface, or in the ocean circulation.  Interactions of both are also
possible, due to, for example SST affecting clouds and clouds affecting the
surface radiation.  \cite{zhang2023} have shown that SST biases have improved
in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5 (relative to ERA5), with SST overall increasing in
the later CMIP phase. However, over the SO this resulted in an even higher
positive bias, especially in the Atlantic Ocean (AO) sector of the SO,
increasing by up to 1°C.  \cite{luo2023} identified that the SO SST bias
in an ensemble of 18 CMIP6 models originates not from the surface heat and
radiation fluxes (using reanalyses as a reference), but from a warm bias in the
Northern Atlantic Deep Water.

The main aim of our research is to evaluate the GSRM version of ICON, developed
jointly by nextGEMS, Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) and the Max-Planck-Institute
for Meteorology (MPI-M). Previous studies have identified substantial
large-scale biases in climate model clouds over the Southern Ocean (SO),
affecting sea surface temperature and the Earth’s albedo overall. Our aim is to
quantify how well the high-resolution ICON model is simulating clouds in this
region, particularly in light of the fact that subgrid-scale clouds are not
parameterised in this model. This region is mostly dominated by boundary layer
clouds generated by shallow convection, and these are problematic to observe by
spaceborne lidar and radars, which are affected by attenuation by overlapping
and thick clouds and ground clutter, respectively.  Specifically, the radar on
CloudSat and lidar on CALIPSO are affected by the abovementioned issues,
resulting in a strong underestimation of cloud occurrence below 2 km relative to
ground-based lidar observations \citep{mcerlich2021}.  This, in turn, can lead to
systematic biases in low clouds in climate models, which are frequently
evaluated against CloudSat--CALIPSO products. Reanalyses can also suffer from
cloud biases, as these are usually parametrised in their atmospheric component,
and also in regions where input observations are sparse.  This makes them a
problematic reference for clouds over the SO, and any biases relative to a
reanalysis should be interpreted with caution. Instead, we chose to use a large
set of ship-based observations conducted with ceilometers and lidars on board
of the RV \emph{Polarstern} and other voyages and stations as a reference for
the model evaluation.

Altogether, we analysed over 1500 days of data from 31 voyages and one
sub-Antarctic station covering diverse longitudes of the SO. To
achieve a like-for-like comparison with the model, we used a ground-based lidar
simulator called the Automatic Lidar and Ceilometer Framework (ALCF)
\citep{kuma2021}. We contrasted the results with the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) \citep{era5} and the
Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2
(MERRA-2) \citep{gelaro2017}.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Voyage and station data}

Together, we analysed data from 31 voyages of RV \emph{Polarstern}, resupply
vessel (RSV) \emph{Aurora Australis}, RV \emph{Tangaroa}, RV \emph{Nathaniel B.
Palmer}, Her Majesty's New Zealand Ship (HMNZS) \emph{Wellington} and one
sub-Antarctic station (Macquarie Island) in the SO south of 40°S between year
2010 and 2021 (Fig. \ref{fig:map}, Table \ref{tab:voyages} and
\ref{tab:voyage-references}). Altogether, the voyages and the station comprised
2421 days of data south of 40°S, but the availability of ceilometer data was
smaller due to gaps in measurements. Missing days in the ceilometer data were
HMNZSW16 (7 days): 24--27 November, 10 December, 16--17 December 2016; MARCUS
(3 days): 8, 10 November, 10 December; MICRE (9 days): 7--8, 29 June, 5, 16
July, 15 August, 17 October 2016, 11 February, 21 March 2017; TAN1502 (1 day):
24 January.

These data sources contained ceilometer observations with the Vaisala CL51 and
CL31 operating at 910 nm and the Lufft CHM-15k operating at 1064 nm, described
in detail below (Sections \ref{sec:cl51} and \ref{sec:chm15k}). A ceilometer is
a low-power near-infrared vertically pointing lidar with the purpose of
measuring the cloud base, but it also measures the full vertical structure of
clouds as long as the laser signal is not attenuated by thick clouds.

Apart from lidar observations, radiosondes were launched on weather balloons at
regular synoptic times on the RV \emph{Polarstern}, MARCUS, NBP17024, TAN1702,
and TAN1802 voyage, measuring pressure, temperature, relative humidity and
global navigation satellite system coordinates. Derived thermodynamic (virtual
potential temperature, lifting condensation level, \ldots) and dynamic
quantities (wind speed and direction) for the measured vertical profiles were
calculated with rstool \citep{rstool}. Surface meteorological quantities were
measured continuously by an onboard automatic weather station or individual
instruments.

\subsection{ICON}

A coupled (atmosphere--ocean) GSRM version of the ICON model is in development
by the nextGEMS project \citep{hohenegger2023}. nextGEMS has so far produced
four cycles of model runs. In our research, we used a Cycle 3 run
\emph{ngc3028} produced in 2023 \citep{nextgems2023a,nextgems2023b}. We could
not use Cycle 4 due to unavailability of the necessary variables. The
horizontal resolution of ngc3028 is about 5 km.  Unlike current general
circulation models (GCMs), the strom-resolving version of ICON does not use
convective and cloud parameterisation but relies on explicit simulation of
convection and clouds on the model grid. While this makes the code development
simpler without having to rely on uncertain parameterisations, it can miss
smaller-scale clouds below the grid resolution.  Turbulence and cloud
microphysics are still parameterised in this model. In our analysis, we used
four years of coupled simulation output between years 2021 and 2024
(inclusive). Because the model is free-running, weather and climate
oscillations (such as the El Niño--Southern Oscillation) are not expected to be
equivalent to reality at the same time and place. To compare with observations
taken during different years (2010--2021), we compared the model output with
observations at the same time of year and geographical location.

ICON is a very versatile model, allowing for simulations ranging from
coarse-resolution ESM simulations, GSRM simulations, limited area model (LAM)
simulations, to large eddy simulations (LES), for both weather prediction and
climate projections.

ICON uses the atmospheric component ICON-A \citep{giorgetta2018}, whose
physics is derived from ECHAM6 \citep{stevens2013}, and the ocean component
ICON-O \citep{korn2022}.

Earlier runs of the GSRM ICON from DYAMOND were evaluated by
\cite{mauritsen2022}.

\subsection{ALCF}

The Automatic Lidar and Ceilometer Framework (ALCF) is a ground-based lidar
simulator. It performs radiative transfer calculations to derive equivalent
lidar backscattered radiation in an atmospheric model, which can then
be compared with observed lidar backscatter \citep{kuma2021}. For this purpose,
it takes atmospheric fields of cloud fraction, liquid and ice mass mixing ratio,
temperature and pressure fields as an input and can be run offline (on the
model output rather than inside the model code). The lidar simulator in the
ALCF is based on the instrument simulator Cloud Feedback Model
Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulator Package (COSP)
\citep{bodas-salcedo2011}. After the backscattered radiation is calculated, a
cloud mask, cloud occurrence by height and the total cloud fraction are
determined.

ALCF has already been used by several research teams for model and reanalysis
evaluation
\citep{kuma2020,kremser2021,guyot2022,pei2023,whitehead2023,mcdonald2024}.

\subsection{Vaisala CL51 and CL31}
\label{sec:cl51}

The Vaisala CL51 and CL31 are ceilometers operating at a near-infrared
wavelength of 910 nm. The maximum range 15.4 km (CL51), 7.7 km (CL31 with 5 m
vertical resolution) and 7.550 (CL31 with 10 m vertical resolution).
The vertical resolution is 10 m (5 m configurable). The wavelength is affected
by water vapour absorption of about 20\% in the mid-latitudes
\citep{wiegner2015,wiegner2019}.  The instrument data files containing
uncalibrated backscatter were first converted to NetCDF with cl2nc
(\url{https://github.com/peterkuma/cl2nc}) and then processed with the ALCF to
produce a cloud mask and cloud occurrence by height and the total cloud
fraction. CL51 can also be configured to emulate CL31.

For the MARCUS voyage, Vaisala CL31 were made available by the Atmospheric
Radiation Measurement (ARM) processed to a maximum range of 7.545 km, vertical
resolution of 30 m and 252 vertical levels.

\subsection{Lufft CHM 15k}
\label{sec:chm15k}

The Lufft CHM 15k is a ceilometer operating at a near-infrared wavelength of
1064 nm. The maximum range is 15.4 km, vertical resolution is 5 m in the near
range (up to 150 m) and 15 m above, the sampling rate is 2 s, and the number of
vertical levels is 1024.  NetCDF files containing uncalibrated backscatter
produced by the instrument were processed with the ALCF to produce a cloud mask
and cloud occurrence by height and the total cloud fraction.

% TODO: Describe absolute calibration.
% TODO: Check sampling rate.

\subsection{MERRA-2}

The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2
(MERRA-2) is a reanalysis produced by the Global Modeling and Assimilation
Office at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center \citep{gelaro2017}.  It uses
version 5.12.4 of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) atmospheric
model \citep{rienecker2008,molod2015}. The reanalysis output analysed here is
available at a spatial resolution of 0.5° in latitude and 0.625° in longitude,
which is about 56 km in the North--South direction and 35 km in the East--West
direction at 60°S. The number of vertical model levels is 72, which we
interpolate to height levels as needed. In our analysis we use the following
products: 1-hourly instantaneous 2D single-level diagnostics (M2I1NXASM) for
2-m temperature and humidity; 3-hourly instantaneous 3D assimilated
meteorological fields (M2I3NVASM) for cloud quantities, pressure and
temperature; 1-hourly average 2D surface flux diagnostics (M2T1NXFLX) for
precipitation and sea ice; and 1-hourly average 2D radiation diagnostics
(M2T1NXRAD) for radiation quantities \citep{merra2}.

\subsection{ERA5}

ERA5 \citep{era5} is a reanalysis produced by the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). It is based on a numerical weather
prediction (NWP) model Integrated Forecast System (IFS) version CY41R2.  The
horizontal resolution is 0.25° in latitude and longitude, which is about
28 km in the North--South direction and 14 km in the East--West direction at
60°S. Internally, the model uses 137 vertical levels. In our analysis we use
output at one hourly instantaeous time intervals, except for radiation
quantities, which are accumulations (from these we calculate daily means).
Vertically-resolved quantities are made available on 37 pressure levels. We
interpolate these quantities to height levels as needed.

\subsection{CERES}

TOA radiation quantities are taken from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant
Energy System (CERES) instruments on board of the Terra and Aqua satellites
\citep{wielicki1996,loeb2018}. In our analysis we use the adjusted all sky SW
and LW upwelling fluxes at TOA from the synoptic TOA and surface fluxes and
clouds 1 degree daily edition 4A product
(CER\_SYN1deg-Day\_Terra-Aqua-MODIS\_Edition4A)
\citep{doelling2013,doelling2016}.

\subsection{Cyclone tracking}

We used a cyclone tracking algorithm to identify extratropical and polar
cyclones (ECs and PCs) over the SO in the reanalysis and ICON data,
for the purpose of partitioning the cloud occurrence data into cyclonic and
non-cyclonic conditions. We used the open source package CyTRACK
\citep{perez-alarcon2024}. Generally, what constitutes an EC is considered
relatively arbitrary due to a very large variability of ECs \citep{neu2013}.
We used the mean sea level pressure field and horizontal wind speed fields
as input to the CyTRACK algorithm. The algorithm uses pressure and wind
speed thresholds as well as tracking across time steps to identify cyclone
centres and radii.

\subsection{Precipitation identification using machine learning}
\label{sec:ann}

Precipitation can cause strong enough lidar backscattering to be recognised as
a cloud by the cloud detection method used in the ALCF. This is undesirable
if equivalent precipitation backscatter is not included in the simulated lidar
profiles. It was not possible to include precipitation simulation in the ALCF
due to the absence of required fields in the ICON model output and the
reanalysis data, the liquid and ice precipitation mass mixing ratios, and
because the required radiation calculations for precipitation are not
implemented in the ALCF. In this situation, in order to achieve a fair
comparison of observations and models, one should exclude profiles with
precipitation either manually or using an automated method. It is relatively
difficult to distinguish precipitation backscatter from cloud backscatter in
lidar observations, especially when only one wavelength channel and no
polarisation channel are available. In models, the same can be accomplished
relatively easily by excluding profiles with an amount of surface precipitation
flux exceeding a given threshold. In the observations, using precipitation
flux measurements can be very unreliable on ships due to ship movement and
turbulence caused by nearby ship structures. Our analysis of rain gauge data
from the RV \emph{Tangaroa} showed large discrepancies between the rain gauge
time series and human-performed synoptic observations, as well as large
inconsistencies in the rain gauge time series. Therefore, it is desirable to
implement a method of detecting precipitation from observed backscatter
profiles instead.

On the RV \emph{Polarstern} voyages, regular human-performed synoptic
observations were available and included precipitation presence and type. We
used this dataset to train a convolutional artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) of
the U-Net type \citep{ronneberger2015} to recognise profiles with precipitation
from lidar backscatter. Samples of short time intervals (10 min) of
near-surface backscatter (0–250 m) were classified as clear, rain, snow and
fog, using the synoptic observations as a training dataset. From these, a
binary classification of profiles as wet (rain or fog) and dry (clear or fog)
was derived.

The ANN achieved 65\% sensitivity and 87\% speciﬁcity when the true positive
rate (26\%) was made to match observations. We considered these success rates
satisfactory for the purpose of filtering precipitation profiles.

\subsection{Data processing}

The radiation calculations were done in such a way that they always represent
averages of daily means. This is done in order to be consistent with the CERES
SYN1deg data, which are expressed as daily means. Therefore, for every
instantaneous profile in the simulated lidar data is assigned a daily mean
radiation value corresonding to theo the day (in UTC). In turn, the average
radiation during the entire voyage or station measurement is calculated as the
average of the profile values. In the observed lidar data, the daily mean
radiation value is taken from the spatially and temporally co-located CERES
SYN1deg data for the day (in UTC). The voyage or station measurement average
is calculated in the same way.

\label{fig:cloud-occurrence-panel}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Cloud occurrence}

We used the ALCF to derive cloud occurrence by height and the total cloud
fraction from observations, ICON and two reanalyses MERRA-2 and ERA5 (Fig.
\ref{fig:cloud-occurrence-panel}). We aggregated the sources by calculating
the averages and percentiles of all individual profiles (Fig.
\ref{fig:cloud-occurrence}). The analysis shows that the total cloud fraction
(determined as the fraction of proﬁles with clouds at any height in the lidar
cloud mask) is underestimated in ICON and reanalyses by about 10\% and 20\%,
respectively.

In particular, ICON overestimates cloud occurrence below 1 km and
underestimates it above, MERRA-2 underestimates cloud occurrence at all heights,
especially near the surface, and ERA5 simulates cloud occurrence relatively well
above 1 km, but strongly underestimates it near the surface.
We note that fog or near-surface clouds are strongly lacking in the reanalyses.
As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:cloud-occurrence-panel}, the biases are relatively
consistent across voyages and longitudes. The ICON results are overall better
matching the observations than the reanalyses.

The ICON comparison is limited by the fact that the model is free-running.
Thus, the vertical proﬁles are not expected to represent the same weather
conditions as in observations, but long-term statistical comparison is still
possible. Only proﬁles with the same sea ice conditions (present or not) were
included to avoid comparing sea ice with open sea conditions.

The observations show cloud occurrence peaking at the surface, whereas models
show higher peak (at about 500 m). The models underestimate total cloud
fraction by 10--20\%, and show a strong decrease in cloud occurrence near the
surface, but this is not happening in the observations. ICON and ERA5
overestimate cloud occurrence at the peak (between 0--1 km). Above 1 km, ICON
and MERRA-2 understimate cloud occurrence, but ERA5 is very accurate. The too
high peak in models is partly supported by the LCL distribution, which peaks
higher in the models then in the observations (at the surface), although this
is not very pronounced. The northern zone shows stronger peak of cloud
occurrence near the surface than the southern zone, and this could be because
higher latitudes have more unstable atmospheric profiles. The northern and
southern zones show similar biases in models as in the general case, but ERA5
does not overestimate the peak in the northern zone (near-surface cloud
occurrence is still strongly understimated). Cyclonic situations have a larger
amount observed cloudiness, including the peak and total cloud fraction. In
these situations, the models are doing a relatively good job of getting the
vertical profile of cloud occurrence right, but still tend to underestimate
cloud occurrence above 1 km and near the surface. Non-cyclonic situations are
similar to the general case. In stable stituations cloud occurrence peaks
strongly at the surface in observations, compared to unstable situations, where
the peak is more more obtuse and spread across 0--1 km. In stable situations
the models are doing a fairly good job, but overestimate cloud occurrence at
the peak below 1 km, above 1 km the show similar biases as in the general case.
In unstable situations the bias in ICON is very pronounced, with a much
stronger peak at about 500 m, ERA5 is underestimating cloud occurrence below 1
km (especially near the surface), and MERRA-2 even more strongly. In all
situations, even when the models overestimate cloud occurrence at some
altitudes, they always substantially underestimate the total cloud fraction.
ICON can be generally characterised as substantially overestimating cloud
occurrence below 1 km and underestimating above, underestimating the total
cloud fraction, and showing greatest biases in unstable and non-cyclonic
conditition. It also shows peak of cloud occurrence at higher altitude than obs
(500 m vs. near the surface) and correspondingly its LCL tends to be also
higher. MERRA-2 can be generally characterised as underestimating cloud
occurrence at nearly all altitudes as well as the total cloud fraction, but
mostly above and below 500 m (the peak at 500 m is well-represented). It
struggles the most in the northern zone, and in unstable situations. ERA5 can
be generally characterised as representing cloud occurrence correctly above
about 1--1.5 km, overestimating below, but underestimating near-surface cloud
occurrence (0--500 m). The total cloud fraction is strongly understimated in
all situations. It has tendency towards understimation in the northern zone and
unstable stiuations, and conversely overestimating in the southern zone and
stable conditions.

\subsection{Thermodynamic proﬁles}

We analysed about 2300 radiosonde proﬁles south of 40°S from the 24 RV
\emph{Polarstern} voyages, MARCUS, NBP1704, TAN1702, and TAN1802.



voyages between the observations and the model. Proﬁles in the model were taken
at the same geographical location and time relative to the start of the year.
Only proﬁles for which the sea ice conditions (sea ice present or absent) are
the same in the observations and the model were included. We derived potential
temperature profiles, lifting condensation level (LCL), and aggregated the
profiles by sea ice conditions (Fig. \ref{fig:radiosonde}).

We found that the variability of potential temperature in the model to be
smaller than in the observations. This indicates that the model does not
represent the entire natural variability. The LCL peaks at the surface in the
observations, but the peak in the model is higher (about 200 m). This probably
relates to the greater occurrence of fog and the peak of cloud occurrence at
the surface in observations, whereas in the model the peak is higher.

\subsection{Cloud occurrence by cyclonic conditions}

\subsection{Cloud occurrence by stability}

We determine stability by calculating lower tropospheric stability (LTS)
as the difference between potential temperature at 700 hPa and the surface.
From a histogram of LTS in ERA5 and MERRA-2 calculated at all voyage tracks
and the station (Fig. S1), we determined a dividing threshold of 12 K for
relatively unstable (< 12 K) and relatively stable (>= 12 K) conditions.

\section{Discussion}

Similar to our results \cite{cesana2022} showed that CMIP6 also tend to
underestimate cloud occurrence above 2 km over the SO, although their analysis
in this case was limited to liquid clouds.

\section{Conclusions}

We show that the model underestimates the total cloud fraction by about 10\%,
with an overestimation of clouds below 2 km, and an underestimation of clouds
above 2 km. The reanalyses also underestimate the total cloud fraction by about
20\%.  ERA5 overestimates cloud below 1 km but underestimates near-surface
cloud or fog. In addition to lidar data, we compare radiosonde profiles
acquired on the RV \textit{Polarstern} voyages with ICON. Notably, the model
exhibits smaller natural variability than observations, and its lifting
condensation level tends to be higher. This might explain why cloud occurrence
is peaking higher in the model (at 500 m) than in observations (at the
surface).

We compared radiosonde proﬁles acquired on the RV \emph{Polarstern} voyages
with ICON.  The ICON model exhibits smaller internal variability than
observations, and its LCL level tends to be higher, which might explain why a
peak of cloud occurrence in observations is located at the surface, while in
ICON it is located higher, corresponding to the LCL.

The results imply that SO cloud biases are still a significant
issue in a km-scale resolution model, even though an improvement over the
lower-resolution reanalyses is notable. More effort is needed to improve model
cloud simulations in this fast-changing and understudied region. The
advancement from convection and cloud parameterisation to cloud-resolving models
might not solve this bias without additional effort.

Further analysis will focus on investigating the role of cyclones in the
identified biases by using cyclone tracking and the role of local thermodynamic
stability using lower tropospheric stability and estimated inversion strength.
